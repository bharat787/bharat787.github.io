        <h1>Hi, I'm Bharat ヾ(＾-＾)ノ</h1>
        <p>I'm a tech generalist, more aptly described as <em>"Jack of all trades, and mastering the art of learning".</em></p>
        <p>Over the years, I've got my hands dirty coding (or reverse engineering) mobile and web apps dabbled with smart contracts and played around with drones, Raspis' and Arduinos.</p>
        <p>Currently completing my Masters in Computer Science at Arizona State University, I've also worked with MNCs and startups. I also frequent hackathons.</p>
